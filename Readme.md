# About and Learning Recommendations

This is a small fan project showing the basics of web development with HTML CSS and Javascript. Feel free to yoink the code and try yourself! 

For further reading I can recommend:

- https://css-tricks.com/guides/ for CSS guides
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web MDN also great site for almost anything!
- Don't be afraid to look up your error on the internet (mostly Stackoverflow) and learn what the error messages mean! Even an LLM can help you solve things.

Happy coding!
